        <h1>UX Was Here</h1>

        <div class = "projects">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p><a class = "in-text-link" href = "https://uxwashere.com/">UX Was Here</a> is an inclusive platform for individuals of all experience levels who are passionate about UX to connect and learn.  However, the main problem they face is the high turnover and low usage rate.  Therefore, our project set out to tackle these this issue by leveraging existing platform features, such as the explore and event discovery pages, with goals to foster long-term engagement and active participation.  This project was submitted for the <a class = "in-text-link" href = "https://eunoiadesign.ca/">2024 Eunoia UX Design Jam</a>.</p>

            <h2>Client Goals</h2>
            <p>Firstly, our team worked together to define the goals of the client.  We found that UX Was Here wants to understand the motivations that drive users to engage with the community on the platform.  They would also like to better guide users through the onboarding process by simplifying the sign-in page and directing users towards key features.  Another objective is to retain existing users by creating a sense of belonging, and by identifying barriers that prevent them from becoming active members.  Finally, UX Was Here would like to refine their brand identity to reflect their values, while also enhancing their visual appeal and user-friendliness.  Due to time constraints, we opted to focus primarily on the challenge of increasing user activity on the platform, which aligns with their goal promoting connectivity.</p>

            <h2>Existing Features</h2>
            <div class = "project-img">
                <img src="img/ux-was-here-events.png" alt="UX Was Here's Events page, displaying a few events, their dates, and option to share or view more info.">
            </div>

            <p>Upon reviewing the website's different pages, we found that UX Was Here already has some pretty great features catering the diverse needs of their users.  The explore page creates a sense of community, serving as a space for users to engage in discussions and share their knowledge.  For those wanting to expand their networks and find learning opportunities, the events page conveniently displays upcoming UX-related events.   Similarly, the jobs page offers users a chance to discover careers in the field.  Lastly, we noticed an upcoming messaging feature, which was a potential area for us to explore.</p> 

            <p>Although these features serve the intended purposes UX Was Here well, we identified a lack of sustained interaction beyond the initial engagement.  While users can create posts and browse events and jobs, we noticed a lack of follow-up or ongoing engagement mechanisms.  This prompted us to brainstorm ways we could enhance these features or introduce additional elements to provide users with a reason to return to the site on a regular basis.</p>

            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>By exploring similar UX communities such as Design Buddies, Iterate UX, and ADPList, we discovered that each of these sites had some unique features that set them apart from the crowd.  For instance, Iterate UX hosts collaborative design challenges that are open to people all around the world.  ADPList offers a mentorship system where users can book sessions and get support from industry professionals on various topics, providing valuable guidance to early-career individuals.  Based on these sites, there is a clear need for UX Was Here to establish features that differentiate it from other platforms.</p>

            <h2>Target Audience & Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>During the opening ceremony of the Eunoia UX Design Jam, an intriguing topic that is often overlooked was brought up: tips for networking as an introvert.  This inspired our group to focus on introverted individuals as our target audience, since UX Was Here must be inclusive of everyone.  This led to our problem statement:</p>

            <p>How might we enable introverted users to network and establish real-life connections effectively before an event?</p>

            <h2>Conducting a Survey</h2>
            <p>We decided to conduct a survey amongst 34 diverse UX designers with varying experience levels to gather a sense of their needs and feelings when networking and participating in UX-related events.  From this survey, we found that networking events are an extremely popular way for designers to connect.  A key statistic is that 76% of respondents admitted they felt uncomfortable when networking with new people.  Some reasons included impostor syndrome, a fear of being rejected, and a lack of confidence in their design skills.</p>

            <p>When such concerns affect a majority of people, it is necessary to implement features where users can connect beforehand to reduce anxiety have a sense of the people they will be interacting with.  Also, the platform can promote collaboration and skill-building by integrating fun design activities in a relaxed and welcoming environment.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our team decided to challenge ourselves by prototyping a mobile app version of the site, with a main focus on enhancing the events page.  In the event details, we added a list of attendees.  This feature provides users who are thinking of attending an event with insights into its diversity, and the individuals who will be present.  Also, users are able to swiftly connect with attendees by following them or sending them a message.</p>

            <p>Another key feature on this page is the addition of an event group chat.  For every event, users have the option of joining an existing group chat, providing them with the opportunity to get to know other attendees early on.  This feature is helpful for our target audience of introverts as it can help alleviate their stress and empower them to take the first step in connecting with others, especially if tend to feel uncomfortable doing so in real life.</p>

            <p>As mentioned, some respondents of our survey stated that they are not confident in their design skills.  Since UX Was Here is a platform for people with all levels of experience, students and early-career individuals may feel some sort of barrier towards attending events, believing they lack the experience to participate.  Therefore, by including online “design sprint” events, users can collaborate on design activities in a low-stakes environment, without feeling overwhelmed.  For further comfort, users are matched with others that possess similar experience levels, ensuring that everyone feels included.</p>

            <p>Lastly, we revamped the explore page to make it more accessible.  Rather than only showing community posts, it now offers personalized recommendations, suggesting users to follow based on mutual connections, location, or shared experiences.  It also recommends group chats that the user may be interested in.</p>

            <p>The implemented features effectively address our problem statement and align closely with the goals of UX Was Here.  Introverts are able to utilize these new features to their advantage to meet new people and expand their networks.  Moreover, users can practice their design skills by collaborating with others on the platform, therby promoting active participation and engagement.  By providing more opportunities for users to connect right away, they are more likely to return to the platform to interact with their established connections, strengthening user retention.</p>

            <h2>Mockups</h2>
            <p></p>

            <h2>Bonus Features</h2>
            <p>Apart from the main features, we also designed a new logo for UX Was Here by experimenting with typography and integrating the iconic Kilroy Was Here doodle into it.</p>

            <p>Also, we designed a mobile version of the sign up page to ensure an efficient and user-friendly onboarding process.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>From this project, I learned that it is extremely important to establish our problem statement and target audience near the beginning of the process.  A challenge our team faced is that we were too eager to jump into possible solutions, resulting in many that did not address a clear problem or a defined goal.  This lesson is something I will carry forward into my future projects.</p>
